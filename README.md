# TaskCLI
A CLI Task tracker with a bunch of commands in it
This is my first project after about three months of studying Python, during which I also focused on machine learning. It's my first time working on a project independently without dealing with ML concepts. I tried to apply what Iâ€™ve learned, and I think it's not bad for my first project. This CLI is a task tracker with a set of commands that can be run directly from the terminal. The tracker data is saved in a JSON file, and it provides a set of default commands that are sufficient for managing tasks in a simple way.
